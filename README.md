# NC Bulk District Lookup Tool
This uses the [Find Your Legislator Tool](https://www.ncleg.gov/FindYourLegislators) which allows you to look up a the previous and new district for a single address.  

With redistricting, this script will allow you to find a list of users that have moved from one district to another, and potentially send “transition” emails, welcoming these constituents to the new district.

With a list of addresses, it allows you to retrieve the previous and new district numbers for all addresses provided.

For assistance with this script, please reach out to Mike Fotinatos (michael.fotinatos@gmail.com).  Note that the addresses have to be in NC.
